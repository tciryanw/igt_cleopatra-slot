    <h1>Payback Information</h1>
    <p>In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide, each and every game outcome is completely independent except in cases where one spin unlocks a feature for a subsequent spin or series of spins, per the game
        rules. The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same. </p>
    <p>The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc. For example, if the top award is won on a given spin of the game, the chances of winning the top award on the next spin are exactly the same. Likewise,
        prior losses do not change future odds. </p>
    <p>The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of spins by numerous players over an extended period of time. </p>
    <p>For this game, the long-term, theoretically expected payback is {RTP}. The results for any given player over a play session can vary widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, the wider
        the normal variance of actual payback may be experienced.</p>
    <p>The expected payback value is also based upon correct player choices for any games which involve main game and/or bonus game play strategy.</p>
    <p>
        The maximum win on any transaction including the results of the <i>Free Spins Bonus</i>, plus the outcome which launched the bonus, is capped at
        <currency>{awardCap}.</currency>
