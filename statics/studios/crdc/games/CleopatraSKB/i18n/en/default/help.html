        <p>
            <h2><i>Cleopatra Bonus</i></h2>
            <p>Trigger the <strong><i>Cleopatra Bonus</i></strong> by getting three or more Sphinx scatter symbols anywhere on the reels.</p>
            <p>Sphinx scatter symbols appear on reels 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.</p>
            <p>Triggering the <strong><i>Cleopatra Bonus</i></strong> awards 15 free spins.</p>
            <p>All wins, except 5 <strong><i>Cleopatra</i></strong> symbols, are tripled in the bonus.</p>
            <p>If three or more Sphinx scatter symbols appear anywhere on the reels during a free spin, an additional 15 free spins are added to the current <i>Free Spins Bonus</i> (up to a maximum of 180 total free spins within any bonus round).</p>
            <p>Free spins are played at the same line bet and same number of paylines as the triggering spin.</p>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>Misuse or malfunction voids all pays and plays.</p>
            <p>All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel. </p>
            <p>Only the highest winner is paid on each payline. Line wins are multiplied by the line bet on the winning line. Coinciding line wins on different paylines are added. </p>
            <p>Only highest scatter win is paid. Scatter wins are multiplied by the total bet.</p>
            <p>When one or more <strong><i>Cleopatra</i></strong> Wild symbols substitute in a win, that win is doubled.</p>
            <p>Scatter and bonus wins are independent from payline wins and are also added to the total amount paid.</p>
            <p>Wins are shown in currency.</p>
            <p>In some jurisdictions, regardless of bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction. See the paytable for details. A transaction includes the results of the <i>Cleopatra Bonus</i> plus the outcome which launched the bonus. If the
                award cap is reached in the bonus, the bonus ends immediately, even if there are remaining free spins.</p>
            <h4>Expected Payback</h4>
            <p>In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide, each and every game outcome is completely independent except in cases where one spin unlocks a feature for a subsequent spin or series of spins, per the
                game rules. The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same. </p>
            <p>The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc. For example, if the top award is won on a given play of the game, the chances of winning the top award on the next play are exactly the same.
                Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds. </p>
            <p>The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of plays by numerous players over an extended period of time. The results for any given player over a play session can vary widely from this long-term, expected
                average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, the wider the normal variance of actual payback that may be experienced. </p>
